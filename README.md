## What I have done 
- All features mandatory : 
- Search filter for Title and Content 
- Limit 10 articles displayed (reverse, because we want the 10 last articles)
- Biographie of an author & bibliographie (ie, articles written by the author)
- List of all authors & number of articles / author
- Somme styles ...

Also : 
- My app is in production environment
- My app is instalable 
- The app uses cache, with preloaded api calls

## CI / CD :
- Linting
- Deployment to https://polytech-paris-sud-web.github.io/TP2-PaulZIOLKOWSKI/


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Don't forget to launch the `json-server` ! 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
